**Question 2**

The following code draws random samples from heads and tails, assuming that
there is an equal probability of each and stores the proportion of heads.

```{r}
N <- 10000
phat_set <- rep(0, N)
for (i in seq_len(N))
{
  coin <- sample(c("heads", "tails"), size=300, replace=TRUE)
  phat <- mean(coin == "heads") * 100

  phat_set[i] <- phat
}
```

The following gives the p-value of the experiment for an observed value.

```{r}
your_phat_value <- 55
mean(abs(phat_hat) >= your_phat_value)
```

If you want the plot as well, run this code:

```{r}
your_dhat_value <- 55

library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

df <- data_frame(phat = round(phat_set))
ggplot(df, aes(factor(phat))) +
  geom_bar(color = "black", fill = "white") +
  geom_bar(color = "black", fill = "black",
           data = filter(df, abs(phat) >= your_phat_value)) +
  xlab("Values of phat") + ylab("Count") +
  theme_minimal()
```
