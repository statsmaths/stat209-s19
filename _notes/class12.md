## Learning Objectives

- List the key components of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Describe and memorize the modes of EDA
- Infer possible data sources from interactive visualizations
- Make an oral presentation from a data analysis

## Exploratory Data Analysis

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is the process of trying to
understand what a dataset can tell us outside of a narrowly focused
probability statement. It relies heavily on graphical devices and summary
statistics. EDA is a very important aspect of data analysis and will
contribute a large part of what we work on this semester.

### Today

Hans Rosling’s 200 Countries, 200 Years, 4 Minutes:

- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbkSRLYSojo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbkSRLYSojo)

I have shown this to nearly all of my statistics courses, and while a bit dated it is still the best representation of what EDA is all about.

### Types of data sets

Data can include such things as text:

- [Google search suggestions by country](https://noahveltman.com/suggest/)

Maps:

- [NYC Taxi's: A Day in the Life](http://chriswhong.github.io/nyctaxi/)

And here, even one with sound:

- [Off the Staff](https://www.c82.net/offthestaff/)
- [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLw6QMmIiPBlU_dElMDoJn4RUBvpp_bUwi&v=DxkpN4PUOzA)

Today the projects groups will look at will cover a similarly wide range of
data set types.

## Exploratory data analysis

What's the point of an exploratory, visual analysis? At a high level we are
trying to understand something about the world around us. The EDA phase of
analysis let's us discover what the data at hand is specifically telling us
and indicates directions for future studies.

Here is a project from the Digital Scholarship Lab (DSL) at the University of
Richmond that does a great job of showing how visualizations can be powerful
argumentative tools:

- [Forced Migration of Enslaved People](https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/forcedmigration/)

If you are not familiar with the DSL, I encourage you to check out their
projects and visit the group's space in the library. I plan to have
someone from the DSL join us for a class later in the semester.

## Modes of Analysis in EDA

Generally, when doing EDA we are looking at understanding patterns
contained within the data. I tend see that interesting observations
come in one of three forms:

- *pattern description*: an observation about a general pattern
or trend found in the dataset
- *anomaly detection*: identification of data points that, in some
way, seem to not follow the general pattern or otherwise behave
in some extreme or anomalous way
- *perspective*: we have a special interest in a small set of data
points (often just one) and are interested in how this point falls
relative to the rest of the data; like anomaly detection, but we
decide which points to care about ahead of the analysis

These do not function in a vacuum and good analyses will often pull
from multiple types of observations.

## Questions

For today, here are some questions to answer about as we look at interactive
visualizations:

1. What is the source of the data?
2. What are some of the variables (measurements) being used in
the visualization?
3. What types of visualizations are being used? If you don't know the
exact name of something, just describe it.
4. What are 2-3 interesting observations you found in the dataset?

I'll answer these for the Forced Migration dataset, then let you work on these
questions in small groups.

## Groups

Now, its your turn. I have gather several interactive visualizations
that I find particularly interesting. You'll be split into groups of
and assigned one of these datasets.

- [A Day in the Life](http://flowingdata.com/2015/12/15/a-day-in-the-life-of-americans/)
- [Visualizing MBTA Data](http://mbtaviz.github.io/)
- [The Wizards’ shooting stars](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/sports/wizards-shooting-stars/)
- [The Voting Habits of Americans Like You](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/06/10/upshot/voting-habits.html)
- [The Rhythm of Food](http://rhythm-of-food.net/#explore)
- [Executive Abroad](https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/executiveabroad/)
- [Foreign Born Population (1850-2000)](https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/foreignborn/)
- [#SOTU2014: See the State of The Union address minute by minute on Twitter](http://twitter.github.io/interactive/sotu2014/#p1)
- [A Map of Baseball Nation](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/04/24/upshot/facebook-baseball-map.html)

Spend about 15 minutes playing around with the visualization and
understanding the data within it. Then, answer the four questions above.
Finally, designate one person to come up and explain the answers to your
dataset.
