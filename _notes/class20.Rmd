# Grouping data

Today we are going to look at the NYC flights dataset once again:

```{r, message = FALSE}
flights <- read_csv("https://statsmaths.github.io/stat_data/flights.csv")
```

Our object of study will be the function `group_by`, a **dplyr**
verb that seemingly does nothing (or very little) to a dataset.
Here, we group the flights data by month:

```{r}
group_by(flights, month)
```

Other than a note in the output, the dataset is completely unchanged.
I like to think of the `group_by` function as putting a post-it note
on the dataset saying "treat unique combinations of the grouped variables
as their own data frames". When passing the output of this function
to `summarize`, it will not return one summary row *for each group*.

For example:

```{r}
flights %>%
  group_by(month) %>%
  summarize(avg_dep_delay = mean(dep_delay),
            avg_arr_delay = mean(arr_delay),
            n = n())
```

We see that flights in June take off on average 20 minutes late, whereas
flights in November took off only a 5.4 minutes late.

We can group by multiple variables at once as well. Here we show the
average departure delay by airport and by month:

```{r}
flights %>%
  group_by(origin, month) %>%
  summarize(avg_dep_delay = mean(dep_delay),
            avg_arr_delay = mean(arr_delay),
            n = n()) %>%
  ggplot(aes(month, avg_dep_delay)) +
    geom_point(aes(color = origin), size = 4) +
    geom_line(aes(color = origin)) +
    scale_color_viridis(discrete = TRUE)
```

Notice that when grouping by multiple variables the summarize
function *peels off* the outer most layer of the grouping:

```{r}
flights %>%
  group_by(origin, month) %>%
  summarize(avg_dep_delay = mean(dep_delay),
            avg_arr_delay = mean(arr_delay),
            n = n())
```

To remove all grouping, using the `ungroup()` function:

```{r}
flights %>%
  group_by(origin, month) %>%
  summarize(avg_dep_delay = mean(dep_delay),
            avg_arr_delay = mean(arr_delay),
            n = n()) %>%
  ungroup()
```

It is also possible to use grouped data with `mutate` and
`filter`. For example, here we return the 3 latest flights
for each day in the dataset:

```{r}
flights %>%
  group_by(year, month, day) %>%
  filter(rank(desc(arr_delay)) <= 3) %>%
  select(year, month, day, arr_delay)
```

Here, we see what proportion of the arrival delays is taken
up by each destination airport:

```{r}
flights %>%
  group_by(origin, dest) %>%
  summarize(dep_delay_total = sum(dep_delay)) %>%
  mutate(dep_delay_prop = dep_delay_total / sum(dep_delay_total) * 100) %>%
  arrange(desc(dep_delay_prop))
```

Yes, pipes with chained together grouped mutates and summaries
can get complex very quickly! Try to keep up with the basic ideas
and the more complicated examples will begin making sense soon.

# Variable types in plots

The `factor` function turns any variable into a factor
variable; a factor is a type of object that R knows to treat as categories.
We can use the `mutate` function to make a permanent
change, or apply it inline to effect the way a plot is built.
For example, compare this:

```{r}
filter(flights, day == 1, hour > 21) %>%
  ggplot(aes(dep_delay, arr_delay)) +
    geom_point(aes(color = month)) +
    theme_minimal()
```

And this:

```{r}
filter(flights, day == 1, hour > 21) %>%
  ggplot(aes(dep_delay, arr_delay)) +
    geom_point(aes(color = factor(month))) +
    theme_minimal()
```

Alternatively, if a variable is truly continuous we can convert
it into a factor by using the `cut` function. This function splits
the range of the variable into evenly sized buckets and associates
each input with a specific value of the bucket. For example,
take the following example:

```{r}
filter(flights, day == 1, hour > 21) %>%
  ggplot(aes(dep_delay, arr_delay)) +
    geom_point(aes(color = cut(dep_delay, 4))) +
    theme_minimal()
```

Of course, we would usually not color the points using the same
variable as one of the axes, but this helps illustrate what the
function is doing.
